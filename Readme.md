# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: Session Hijacking/Fixation

Description: I used the tool provided by codepath to obtain the PHPSESSIONID. First I logged in on the Blue page, then simulate on the safari browser an attacker obtaining the PHPSESSIONID.

Vulnerability #2: SQL Injection

Description: The blue page on the Find a Sales person section is vulnerable to sql injection. The other pages sanitized the data properly. A way to test if an input is vulnerable to injection is to try a time based attack to try to delay the query and also can confirm which database managment system is use.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

Description: From the menu, choose the "Login" screen. Enter on username the one already provided "jmonroe99" and enter any text on password. Click on submit. The message "Log in was unsuccessful." on bold letter will appear. Looking into the inspected html we can see the message has the css class = "failure". Now enter any other text as username, example: test password:test. The same message appears, however, this time it is not on bold letter. Also, if you inspect the html code, we can see the css class = "failed". This is a vulnerability because it is giving sensitive information to an attacker. If the username exists a certain css class is applied.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting

Description: Used the example provided by codepath to generate a xss script: <script>alert('Ana found the XSS!');</script>. First a user add a comment and attach the xss script on the feedback section. Then once the admin user logs in and check the feedbacks, the xss script will be executed.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Description:

Vulnerability #2: Insecure Direct Object Reference

Description: From the menu, go to "Find a sales person", then select one of the sales persons available. You can see on the URL there is a parameter "id". This id parameter receives a value that is used directly to retrieve the sales person information from the database. In the case of the blue and green sites, when selecting a value of 10 or 11 in the id parameter, the screen redirects to the "Find a SalesPerson" page. Seems the page is checking the user access to not allow show sensitive information. However on the red page, when changing the value to 10 or 11, it allows to see sensitive information like people that is already fired.
